# cooperative-games
The objective of this code is to implement a cooperative optimization algorithm that allocates a fixed amount of power from an electric system to a group of agents in a way that maximizes their collective satisfaction. The satisfaction of each agent is calculated based on a satisfaction function that takes into account the price of electricity, the agent's level of consumption, and their comfort level. The algorithm then calculates the total satisfaction of all agents and allocates power to each agent in proportion to their individual satisfaction, with the goal of maximizing the total satisfaction of all agents. Finally, the code prints the power allocation for each agent.
